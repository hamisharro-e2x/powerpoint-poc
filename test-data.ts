                  <li id="preparation-step--0-0">Place flour, butter, 140 g water and salt in mixing bowl then mix <nobr>20 sec/speed 4</nobr>.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--0-1">If not coming together, add 15-30 g water and mix <nobr>10 sec/speed 5</nobr>. Tip out, shape into a ball then flatten into a disc. Wrap in cling film and place in fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, grease a springform tin (Ø 20 cm).</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--0-2">On a lightly-floured surface, roll out three quarters of chilled dough to a disc large enough to line prepared tin with a 3 cm overhang (5 mm thick, approx. Ø 30 cm). Line tin with rolled dough, pressing in well, then place in freezer for 15-20 minutes until firm. Meanwhile, continue with recipe.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--0-3">Roll out remaining pastry to a disc (Ø 25 cm). Place on a sheet of baking paper then set aside in fridge and make filling.</li>

              <ol>
                  <li id="preparation-step--1-0">Place cider and thyme in mixing bowl then, with simmering basket in place of measuring cup, reduce <nobr>8 min/Varoma/speed 1</nobr>. Meanwhile, melt butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. Add mushrooms and 1 pinch salt to pan then sauté for 5-10 minutes until all liquid has evaporated (see tip). Set aside.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--1-1">Add chicken soup and mustard to mixing bowl then stir <nobr>10 sec/speed 3</nobr>.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--1-2">Add chicken then transfer to a large bowl. Add sautéed mushrooms, pepper and ½ tsp salt then stir and set aside to cool.</li>

                  <li id="preparation-step--2-0">Preheat oven to 200°C. Once pastry is firm, remove tin from freezer and pour in cooled pie filling. Once edge of pastry has softened sufficiently, fold in over filling then brush with a little beaten egg.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--2-1">Remove reserved pastry from fridge and cut out a disc (Ø 20 cm). Lay on top of pie, pressing the edges to seal. Crimp edges with a fork or fingers to form a firm seal then brush all over with beaten egg. Use pastry trimmings to decorate top of pie as desired then brush decorations with remaining beaten egg. Using a sharp knife, cut 2 small slits in centre to allow steam to escape then bake for 45-50 minutes (200°C) until browned.</li>
                  <li id="preparation-step--2-2">Leave in tin to rest for 10 minutes then carefully remove from tin. Leave pie on base to serve.</li>
